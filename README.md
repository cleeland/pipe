# pipe
Pipe (a programming learning environment) for Mac OS source code.

This source code is very old, like in ancient old. It is only provided since Pipe is no longer sold and no longer runs on modern Mac OS. You are free to tinker with it and try to compile it for personal use.

The source is provided as-is without any warranty of any kind. Please mind that some of the source code files may contain components with Apple open source licenses or other stuff. Copyright information on top of each source file applies.

I cannot provide any support or help with this.
