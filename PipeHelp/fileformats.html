<p>
Pipe supports two different formats for saving scripts: bundles and flattened files. Bundles are actually directories with multiple files inside, which are treated like a single entity by Mac OS X. On the other hand, flat files really consist of just one binary file. This makes it easier to transfer them over e-mail or the web, or to put them in a source control system.
</p>

<p>
It is generally recommended to use bundles when saving Pipe scripts; you should use flattened files only when necessary.
