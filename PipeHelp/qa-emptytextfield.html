<p>
When you use Pipe as a service from a single-line text field like Safari’s address bar, it may look as if it returns no output.

<p>
This usually happens when the script output includes a new line character at the end (most scripts do that). The text field isn't really empty, it is just scrolled down by one line. Pressing backspace should show you the actual results.
</p>

<p>
To prevent this from happening, make sure your scripts output only a single line without a new line character.
