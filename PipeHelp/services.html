<p>
Pipe provides a system-wide service which allows you to filter text from any application through scripts in your script browser, to create new scripts based on selected script code, and to use a text selection as input in your script browser.
</p>

<p>
To filter text through a script:
</p>

<div class="instructions">
<ol>
<li>Select text in any services-aware application (e.g. TextEdit, Safari or Mail).</li>
<li>Choose “Services” > “Pipe” > “Filter Through Script…” from the application menu.</li>
<li>In the window that pops up, select a script from the list. (This is the same list of scripts as in the script browser.)</li>
<li>Change the “Reverse Transformation” setting as needed.</li>
<li>If you would like to save the script output to a file, select “Save Output to File”.</li>
<li>Click “OK”. (If you enabled the “Save Output to File” option, Pipe will ask you for a file name.) The results of the script should now appear in your application.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
It is also possible to process files directly from the Finder:
</p>

<div class="instructions">
<ol>
<li>Select a single file in the Finder.</li>
<li>Choose “Finder” > “Services” > “Pipe” > “Process with Script…”</li>
<li>In the window that pops up, select a script from the list. (This is the same list of scripts as in the script browser.)</li>
<li>Change the “Reverse Transformation” setting as needed.</li>
<li>Click “OK”.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> This version of Pipe can only process one file at a time, but this may change in a future release.
</p>

<p>
You can also create new scripts based on a text selection, or use a selection as input in the script browser:
</p>

<div class="instructions">
<ol>
<li>Select the input or script text in any services-aware application.</li>
<li>Choose “Services” > “Pipe” > “New Script from Selection” or “Use as Input” to create a new script or to copy the selection to the input box of the script browser, respectively.</li>
</ol>
</div>
