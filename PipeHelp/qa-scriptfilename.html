<p>
Sometimes it is necessary that the temporary script code files written by Pipe have a special name (e.g. Java files must have a name that matches the name of their primary class).
</p>

<p>
To choose a preferred file name for your script, follow these instructions:
</p>

<div class="instructions">
<ol>
<li>In the script editor, choose “Script” > “Settings…”</li>
<li>In the “Running” tab, enter the preferred file name for your script.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
Pipe will also use the file extension of the preferred file name for temporary files passed to your external editor. For example, if your preferred file name is “script.sh”, Pipe will use the “.sh” extension when you edit the script code in your external editor. This may help your editor recognize the correct file type for syntax highlighting purposes.
